# IONIC_tutorial_project

To run the project just for the web open the project folder and run the following commands:
```
  npm install
  ionic serve
```
To then run it on android run the following commands:
```
  ionic build
  ionic cap add android
  ionic cap run android -l --external
```
  
When the last command finishes running you should see this message on the screen [INFO] Development server running!.
Only after can you run your app on Android Studio.
